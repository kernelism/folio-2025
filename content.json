I learnt a lot about how financial systems were handled a scale!<br /> <br />I significantly improved the debugging experience for our team by integrating CI metrics, like build times, failure trends, and flaky test tracking, directly into our internal portal UI, which sped up issue identification by about 20%.<br />To further streamline troubleshooting, I built a tool that automatically pulls and aggregates logs from various internal Oracle services, cutting diagnosis time by 30 to 40%.<br />I also modernized a chunk of legacy React code, which not only reduced page load times by 10% but also led to a noticeable improvement in user experience and made development smoother and more efficient for the team."

Helped the company procure and manage their data, which was foundational to their mission statement. One of my most challending work experiences.<br /><br />I built and automated a robust data pipeline to handle over 22,000 carbon offset projects and 7 billion credits, pulling from four different data sources.<br />I also managed the underlying PostgreSQL database and handled CI/CD workflows using Azure.<br />On the ML side, I developed a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by Llama 3, optimizing it with LFU caching to improve query speeds by 60%. I extended the system to automatically generate detailed reports and visualizations, and wrote comprehensive load tests that ultimately boosted the overall pipeline performance by 15%."
